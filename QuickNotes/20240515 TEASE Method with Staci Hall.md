TEASE Method to turn Convo into Cash by Creating Rapport instantly, instead of building it slowly:

T- Thanks

Thank them for their comment on your post, for reaching out, for sharing awesome content... whatever makes sense in context.

Eg. "Hey, thanks so much for the comment on my post about earning extra income online. Appreciate you!"

E-Edify

When they share something about themselves, like what they do for a living, what their family is like, the challenge they're facing, etc. Edify them!

A-Ask

Ask good questions and really listen to what they say.

-   What do you currently do for a living?
-   Are you doing anything right now to try and help with that issue?
-   Are you looking for a little wiggle room or something more substantial?
-   What would you like the next step to be?
-   etc.

S-Solve

Offer the best solution to the problem they're having:

Eg. "Based on what you're telling me, I think you may want to try what I've been using to help with ..."

E-Enroll

When you do the first four steps correctly, this step will all but usher itself in. You don't need "Closing Strategies" when you understand the Art of Conversation and what motivates someone to take action.
