Today is 07 May 2024...

And I have 43.39 taka in one of my two bank accounts...

In the other account there is a balance of 15000 taka...from which I am entitled to withdraw 14000 only...these are the money I am saving for last 6 months to manage fund for my next child's delivery which is estimated to be in next month...

I asked for some loose money for conveyance from my wife last night and she could only manage 250 taka from all her sources (different bags)... there's no more money to be given to me... Or I have withdraw from the savings of the other bank....

I already withdrawn 2000 taka from that account today... because I have to provide Money to manage this months chore...

I thought I should spend less on conveyance this month starting from today..

I have 400tk in one MRT pass and 200+ taka in the other...

And I have a conveyance bill amounting 2300 taka which is still due....

I used to take a rickshaw from TSC to my office and vice versa...

But today I went by foot to save money on conveyance...

I saved 20+20=40 taka as conveyance today...

Not a huge saving but it will compound to a good amount in next few weeks...

At least I can afford 5-6 days MRT conveyance from this sayings....

I couldn't do that in last week though...

There were unbearable heat weave across the country for last two weeks...

And also I was suffering from an ache in the back of my right heel for over a month...

Fortunately there was not as much heat today...

And also the ache was not felt big when I walked....(It has not gone totally though)
