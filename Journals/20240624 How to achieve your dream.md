I was pondering on the question **how can one achieve something that is way above his reach?**

It might feel fascinating at first but soon it may feel overwhelming as he strives to go along the path...

Here's a solution that I got from Darren Hardy today...

Just jot down a quick note from Darren Daily where Darren Hardy put emphasis on asking the questions at the very beginning of the goal setting:

"WHAT PAIN ARE YOU GOING TO ENDURE?"

But I have something else to say on this subject...

I think we are prone to abandoning our dream very early if we find it too big to achieve...

For example, for 2+ years I am striving to become be successful in affiliate marketing as side hustle...

I want to out 1.5 hour a day for this and earn side money like $500/m. Initially the goal was a bit bigger like $1000/m and my reason for doing it was accumulating a fund of $10,000. I revised the goal since then. I have found with my limited time I can realistically think of achieving $500/m not more, at this point...

Now here's the thing, I swear...

To become successful in affiliate marketing I have to be successful at promoting stuff online...

And sad but true: It feels boring to do promoting things online...

But I have to do it if I want to become successful in it...

I can do it in Facebook or find traffic from SEO...

The first one is more active and the latter is more passive...

The former is more straight forward, the latter is more sophisticated...

But if I start to thinking about these, I can't stop thinking it and can't make any progress....

So in order to succeed I have to think differently...

**What can I do right now with what I have with me to make progress**

If I answer this, I have to write the following:

What I have right now?
1. A domain name with 10 years validity 
2. A blog with specific focus and appeal
3. A logo
4. A fast hosting
