Just woke up from sleep...

I just seen a dream again...

This one is regarding higher education...

I saw I got chance for higher education in a foreign university...

It is mysterious how I got it...as that was not clear in the dream...

But found my parents are encouraging me to start it asap...

I am as well...

But this is something no one knows....

In the dream the situation was like that there is a vacation of a few days when I am at home....

And I got the news of the admissions...

They gave a very close deadline within the end of this month..

And I am in vacation....

Suddenly I have found that tomorrow is the day for my left...

I totally forgot it...

But my parents recalled it...

Then I remembered I have yet to convey this message to my office especially my boss finance secretary...

I don't think they will discourage me for that...

But it will be a shocking news all on off a sudden for sure...

I was thinking to write to National Amir...

I was thinking if I write then National Amir Sb will forward it to Finance Sb....

This will take a a week or two for sure...

It won't be possible for me to take the admission within the specified date...

I was thinking of postponding the admissions for a later semester....

But my father is telling "it should be start now"

Then this thought also came to my mind...

I am going to get a child again next month...

If I take the admission I can't see it's face when they arrive...

I was really confused what I have to do in this case....

The dream just end like that...
