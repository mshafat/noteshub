The Financial Year 2023-24 just ended 1 day ago. The last day of the financial year 2023-24 was Sunday. For last few years I was in-charge of closing the remittance received in bank and bKash accounts. It is the busiest day as most Jama'ats send their collected chanda in this day and I have to track the head wise breakups and bank deposit sms and sometimes photos of cheques. Last year we stayed around 12:30am to complete all the chanda entry and reporting process. This year it was 1+ hours. But I have to say this year end was a smooth experience. So I want to write which part went well in this year that I would like to repeat in next year as well...

## I updated things as days went...
This year I was proactive from the very beginning of June month. Usually I do a bit delay in issuing receipts of deposits in bank. This year I managed it differently. Last year a handful of deposits of May months were due. This year I started clean. So there were no due receipts for previous months deposit. But I did a mistake in issuing 2 receipts (one for Kustia and the other for Isswardi), for those receipts I issued respectively 50tk and 3tk less than the bank deposited amount. So, I had to await for these two jama'ats next remittance to adjust the mistake. But as there were no other due receipts my mind was free. 

Not only that, I also issued chanda receipts as weeks passed. And before last week there were only 1 deposit left for which I couldn't issue receipts for (I want to remember the name of the jama'at: Bhadughar). This way proves to be a perfect way to tackle these month. Otherwise it can be a make or break at the end.

## This is how I managed last week
I was pretty sincere in the last week than any week in this year. I issued receipts as many as I could in each day so that I could complete each day without any due receipts. So last banking day before 30 June was Thursday (27 June) and I only had 1 due receipts before 29th June (this one was from Nabinagar). I got the head wise breakup of Durgarampur on 29th June night which I issued in 30 June morning. So, I started 30th June with only 1 receipt due of previous days (that is Bhadughar's) and 1 of the 2 mistake still left to be solved (which was regarding Kustia). So the final day began with ease...

## The Final Day of The Year
This is how the final day of the year looked this year...

I left home early at 10:30am but I have found that our home electricy went and there is -500 due in meter. And I couldn't recharge it using my bkash as I do it usually. I had no time to solve this issue so I left home without solving it. But it was a headache which stressed me for next 2 hours. 

I went to office with a break in Tejgaon. I was in Tejgaon jama'at on 29th June 10:30am to 4:30pm to audit their last 3 months (April to June) collection and collect the cheque. I had a plan to purchase a light blue color A4 papers that day but I couldn't as I had to come to Bakshibazar with a cash amounting roughly 22k in pocket. I couldn't follow the plan as I was tensed carrying the money and actually forget to purchase the A4 paper before taking off to Metro Rail. 

So I complete the plan this day. It was 11:30am when I reach office with the A4 papers. Then I started to look at the bank SMS. I started slow and by 3pm I completed 80% of the receipts of SMS in Bank but there are a few sms that we received around 5pm. At around 3pm, I stop for a while and started issuing receipts for bKash deposits. At this time bKash account went full so there were no scope for taking remittance in the account. I completed bKash flawlessly for that reason. 

After bKash has been settled I put my full attention toward clearing the remaining deposits in Bank. By 7:30pm only 3-4 SMS remained to be taken care of. But there was a twist. Finance sb allowed to send chanda in his bKash account from onward. So it was a sudden pain. I got a bit nervous how would I manage it. But Allah helped. Actually I was not in a position to think for a moment and plan as my hand was running without any rest. But with some minimal effort I could manage to prepare an Excel to keep the information of forthcoming remittance in Finance Sb's bKash account. I also assigned Babul bhai to keep the Excel. I have to say, by the grace of Allah, he managed it well and with strong hand.
