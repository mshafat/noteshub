The Financial Year 2023-24 just ended 1 day ago. The last day of the financial year 2023-24 was Sunday. For last few years I was in-charge of closing the remittance received in bank and bKash accounts. It is the busiest day as most Jama'ats send their collected chanda in this day and I have to track the head wise breakups and bank deposit sms and sometimes photos of cheques. Last year we stayed around 12:30am to complete all the chanda entry and reporting process. This year it was 1+ hours. But I have to say this year end was a smooth experience. So I want to write which part went well in this year that I would like to repeat in next year as well...

## I updated things as days went...
This year I was proactive from the very beginning of June month. Usually I do a bit delay in issuing receipts of deposits in bank. This year I managed it differently. Last year a handful of deposits of May months were due. This year I started clean. So there were no due receipts for previous months deposit. But I did a mistake in issuing 2 receipts (one for Kustia and the other for Isswardi), for those receipts I issued respectively 50tk and 3tk less than the bank deposited amount. So, I had to await for these two jama'ats next remittance to adjust the mistake. But as there were no other due receipts my mind was free. 

Not only that, I also issued chanda receipts as weeks passed. And before last week there were only 1 deposit left for which I couldn't issue receipts for (I want to remember the name of the jama'at: Bhadughar). This way proves to be a perfect way to tackle these month. Otherwise it can be a make or break at the end.

## This is how I managed last week
I was pretty sincere in the last week than any week in this year. I issued receipts as many as I could in each day so that I could complete each day without any due receipts. So last banking day before 30 June was Thursday (27 June) and I only had 1 due receipts before 29th June (this one was from Nabinagar). I got the head wise breakup of Durgarampur on 29th June night which I issued in 30 June morning. So, I started 30th June with only 1 receipt due of previous days (that is Bhadughar's) and 1 of the 2 mistake still left to be solved (which was regarding Kustia). So the final day began with ease...

## The Final Day of The Year
This is how the final day of the year looked this year...

I left home early at 10:30am but I have found that our home electricy went and there is -500 due in meter. And I couldn't recharge it using my bkash as I do it usually. I had no time to solve this issue so I left home without solving it. But it was a headache which stressed me for next 2 hours. 

I went to office with a break in Tejgaon. I was in Tejgaon jama'at on 29th June 10:30am to 4:30pm to audit their last 3 months (April to June) collection and collect the cheque. I had a plan to purchase a light blue color A4 papers that day but I couldn't as I had to come to Bakshibazar with a cash amounting roughly 22k in pocket. I couldn't follow the plan as I was tensed carrying the money and actually forget to purchase the A4 paper before taking off to Metro Rail. 

So I complete the plan this day. It was 11:30am when I reach office with the A4 papers. Then I started to look at the bank SMS. I started slow and by 3pm I completed 80% of the receipts of SMS in Bank but there are a few sms that we received around 5pm. At around 3pm, I stop for a while and started issuing receipts for bKash deposits. At this time bKash account went full so there were no scope for taking remittance in the account. I completed bKash flawlessly for that reason. 

After bKash has been settled I put my full attention toward clearing the remaining deposits in Bank. By 8:00pm only 3-4 SMS remained to be taken care of. But there was a twist. Finance sb allowed to send chanda in his bKash account from onward. So it was a sudden pain. I got a bit nervous how would I manage it. There are a few things to manage actually...

- I took the name of Jama'at who wished to pay in bKash but failed due to account limit issue.
- Someone needs to communicate with those Jama'ats representative and convey Finance Secretary Sb's bKash number to send money.
- As Finance sb was not present at that time, how could I ensure that the respective Jama'ats chanda went into his bKash or not?
- How will I handle if there is any mismatch and if I fail to identify an amount?

I got a bit tensed at that time but not for long. Because Allah helped. Actually I was not in a position to think for a moment and plan as my hand was running consistently without any rest. But with some minimal effort I could manage to prepare an Excel to keep the information of forthcoming remittance in Finance Sb's bKash account. I also assigned Babul bhai to keep the Excel. I have to say, by the grace of Allah, he managed it well and in strong hand.  And I announced my colleages to inform those Jama'ats that wished to send money through bKash the new number. I also could craft a message saying 

"To cater the increasing demand, Finance Secretary Sb has given his bKash number 018XXXXXXX for temporary basis. Please share exact amount of chanda you are going to send to the account and also put your Jama'at name in the reference."

Unlike other year end day, Finance Secretary Sb came late to join us this year. He reached at around 8:30 and then he joined force. 

By this time a few Jama'ats also shared their photos of cheque to issue receipts. This year they were Mirpur, Sundarban, Dinajpur, Purulia, Ahmadnagar, Shalshiri, Ashkona, Chattogram. After issuing some of the receipts of cheque sat with Babul bhai, Finance Sb to match the money received in his bKash and tried to knock out one by one. There were 10+ receipts for those and then I focused on issuing receipts for cheques. 

It felt like a never ending day with Jama'ats trying to reach us to pay chanda in bKash and here I am issuing receipts for the amounts. And on top of that I have to entry the issued receipt in Excel for reports before leaving. So there was a gigantic task left. I could finish issuing all the receipts by 12am and then started the Excel entry...


## How I managed the Excel Entry
This year I updated Chanda Paid Status Update Excel almost everyday (sometimes every 2 days). This is how I did it. First I entry the receipts in TRANS and then make a pdf of Period Reports for the days remained to be entered into Excel. Then I entry the amounts in the PDF to the excel and after that I match June Month's collection in 3 heads in Excel to June Months Collection from periodic report of TRANS. This way I could ensure whether I am making a mistake or not. 

I matched excel with trans till 29 June and kept a separate copy of the file and started 30 June. 

Before Finance Sb shared his bKash number to receive chanda, I had some time to update the collection in TRANS. It was after Magrib (I think) and I updated all the issued reeipts till then in TRANS. Then I moved on to update the amount in Chanda Paid Status update and it matched in first instance, Alhamdulillah. 

Then after 12am I put the remaining receipts directly in Excel bypassing TRANS update as we had shortage of time. I finalized the Excel by 12:30am, then Finance Secretary sb printed out a copy of the summary report to share with National Amir sb. We also postponed our dinner till 12:30am. Finance secretary sb didn't permit others to start taking the dinner although it was made ready by 10pm. So, when we started our dinner the warmth of the food went off...

But it was a great dinner, I liked the taste of Kacchi Bhai's dinner, Alhamdulillah...

We left office after 1am...

And reached home at 1:30am...

What a hectic and memorable day...

Thanks to Almighty Allah for making the easy and manageable for us....
