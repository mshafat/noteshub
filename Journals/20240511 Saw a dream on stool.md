Just saw a dream today at around 8:00am 

I saw I am in my drawing room and Tehmeena is left beside me...

Suddenly I saw a stool at my left shoulder...

After that I realized Tehmeena is responsible for the stool on different parts of my cloth and so I carefully managed my clothes and went into bathroom for cleaning...

That was the dream...

When I woke up I saw it is raining...

Thtat's it...

P.S. After I wake up I interpreted the dream as follows, I am going to a huge some of money. And Tehmeena will be help us get those money.
