I always love to go into trenches and meet newbies trying to do affiliate marketing...

Recently I am talking with someone who is doing it for more than 1 year, made a few sale (all randomly) and struggling to put the pieces together...

This is what he did when we started our chat in messenger...

I threw away a link of a paid traffic exchange site...

Then I said I don't like traffic exchanges...

He then shared another...

I said I knew it but it is also a traffic exchange...

Then he sent another and asked if I know it as well...

I said no...but all you are sharing is traffic exchange sites, which I'm not interested to engage...

Then I shed some lights on affiliate marketing to prove that I am in a way better position in this business than he does...

And this made him started to listen...

Then we got connected in Facebook and I saw that he has only a handful of friends and he is posting like crazy, with zero engagement in those posts...

Now after talking for a week or two I realized his perception of affiliate marketing is very different than what I perceive this day...
