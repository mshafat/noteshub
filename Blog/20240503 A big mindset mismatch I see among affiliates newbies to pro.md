It is a big problem I see from newbies to pro affiliates and it breaks fundamental principles
1. Affiliates want people click on their affiliate link but they can't tolerate if other person share their links with them...
2. Pro Marketers want to advertise everywhere they possibly can, but use "Ad blockers" so that no one can show their ads to them...

If this is the strategy, then there is no future...

While it is true that you shouldn't say something you don't do...

Then again, it is also true that you can't forbade something that you do yourself...
