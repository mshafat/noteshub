I was talking with one of my young relative yesterday. I was trying to guide the young man to navigate his life to success, based on what I have learned in last 2 years through entrepreneurship 

The guy was interested in entrepreneurship, especially make money...

So I first tried to make him understand that just making money can't solve the whole puzzle, because it is just one piece...

What I learned by doing online marketing in last 2 years is that...

> You can make a lot of money if you know to provide value to people you want to serve

Because Money is the exchange of value you provide to them...

That's what I said to the guy and put emphasis on thinking more on how to give value to people he wants to serve...

But I found that he is not still clear on this "value" part...

But he is interested in the "money" part which is just the by-product of the "value" in my understanding...

Now based on our conversation I have figured out that he need he thinks "once he has money he can do whatever he wishes to do"

I don't think like this, as I have seen many people losing their hard earned money simply because they don't know how to utilize it for good...

But I want to see the guy to succeed... So I kept providing some "value" to him...

The first value was how to become successful...

## Definition of Success 

And I recently learned a good definition of success from Earl Nightingale. This is what Earl said:

> Success is the progressive realization of an worthy ideal

In his lecture **The Strangest Secret** he described it in details:

> A success is the school teacher who is teaching school because that’s what she wanted to do. The success is the woman who is a wife and mother because she wanted to become a wife and mother and is doing a good job of it. The success is the man who runs the corner gas station, because that’s what he wanted to do. The success is the successful salesman who wants to become a top-notch salesman and grow and build with his organization. A success is anyone who is doing deliberately a predetermined job because that’s what he decided to do deliberately. But only 1 out of 20 does that.

## Success is not always about money. It is more about what you want to become
So my young relative thinks once he earns a good sum of money by doing hard work in a foreign country he can then come to his home country and do whatever he wants to do with the money...

I said it won't happen as I learned another characteristic of success that contradicts with this thought...
