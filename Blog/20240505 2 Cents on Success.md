I was talking with one of my young relatives yesterday. I was trying to guide the young man to navigate his life to success, based on what I have learned in last 2 years through entrepreneurship...

The guy was interested in entrepreneurship, especially making money...(Although entrepreneurship can help one make a lot of money but it is not that narrowly defined thing...)

So I first tried to make him understand that just making money can't solve the whole puzzle, because it is just one piece of that puzzle...

What I learned by doing online marketing in last 2 years is that...

> You can make a lot of money if you know how to provide value to people you want to serve.

Because Money is the exchange of value you provide to them..

Like if you can do hard labor work and someone can't do that hard work you can provide your labor to them and get the money for the value (which is labor in this case) you provided to them.

That's what I said to the guy and put emphasis on thinking more on how to give more value to people he wants to serve...

But I found that he is not still clear on this "value" part...(It takes time I understand so no worries)

But he is interested in the "money" part which is just the by-product of the "value" in my understanding...

Now based on our conversation I have figured out that he thinks "once he has money he can do whatever he wishes to do"

I don't think this way, as I have seen many people losing their hard earned money simply because they don't know how to utilize it for good...

So I asked what you'll do with that money? He wasn't prepared for that to answer but he thinks once he will make the money and will return from the dream land he want to get the money from, he will get the answer...

But I want to see the guy to succeed... So I kept providing some "value" to him...

The first value was how to become successful...

## Definition of Success 

And I recently learned a good definition of success from Earl Nightingale. This is what Earl said:

> Success is the progressive realization of an worthy ideal

In his lecture **The Strangest Secret** he described it in details:

> A success is the school teacher who is teaching school because that’s what she wanted to do. The success is the woman who is a wife and mother because she wanted to become a wife and mother and is doing a good job of it. The success is the man who runs the corner gas station, because that’s what he wanted to do. The success is the successful salesman who wants to become a top-notch salesman and grow and build with his organization. A success is anyone who is doing deliberately a predetermined job because that’s what he decided to do deliberately. But only 1 out of 20 does that.

## Success is not always about money. It is more about what you want to become
So my young relative thinks once he earns a good sum of money by doing hard work in a foreign country he can then come to his home country and do whatever he wants to do with that money...

I said it won't happen as I learned another characteristic of success that contradicts with this thought...

And it is from Jim Rohn but I learned it from Darren Hardy. In one of his Darren Daily he said to his mentor that I want to achieve this and that and his mentor Jim Rohn said, "You can't" because:

> Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you, it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.

In a nutshell, you have to develop yourself so that you can **become** a person of value with a predetermined goal and success will be attracted toward you. 

Now if you are finding it complex to understand, here's I recommend a few simple steps to understand what you need to do.

## Steps to Take
1. Find your passion: Find what makes you happy to do and how you can help more people with that. 
2. Visualize the person: Visualize the person you want to become. 
3. Do the necessaries: Do whatever it takes to do to become that person and help those people you want to serve. 
4. Keep your focus sharp: Until you become the person you visualized to be, keep your dream alive and put consistent actions.
5. Wait for the result: Wait for the the result compounded over time.
