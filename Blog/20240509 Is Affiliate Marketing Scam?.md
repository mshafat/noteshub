For those who just started affiliate marketing, this questions is very obvious...

They feel like affiliate marketing is a scam...

But is it true?

Based on doing the business for last 2 years, the answer obviously for me is "No"

Affiliate Marketing is **NOT** a scam

But it is true the failure rate of Affiliate Marketing is huge more than 95%...

And among those who are in 5% only 2% are getting consistent commissions...

How do I know?

You can do a survey and find the proof, but what I mentioned above is just based on my experience...

Now Why I don't think it as a scam even though the failure rate is so high?

The truth is failure and success rate is not the criteria to determine a scam...

I have found that most people can't make it work because they work on wrong priorities...

Where they should solve the traffic problem first, they sought for something else -- product, funnel, DFY stuff etc.

And here's the irony...

If you can't solve the traffic problem, affiliate marketing will feel like a scam to you...

Because this is the only "job" of affiliate marketer that determines the success of his role...
